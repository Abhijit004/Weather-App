# ⛅ React Weather App

A weather app made using `React` and [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current).

## Initial look
This was the first version of the App.🐤

## Current look
It was later that I realised `OpenWeatherMap` provides much more than I thought, and I should use the information to expand my App, besides making a better UI. Here's what I finally came up with 😎

I additionally used [Chartjs's LineChart](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html) for the Linegraph, and I couldn't be happier after I found ChartJS has some default animating Graphs🤯😍!
